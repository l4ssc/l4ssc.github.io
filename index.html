                <p>Hello there! My name is Alice. I am 19 years old, quoiromantic, asexual, sapphic-sensual, <a href="https://gender.fandom.com/wiki/Genderfae">genderfae</a>, and identify with the <a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Voidpunk">voidpunk</a> subculture. I use <b>fae/faer</b> and <b>it/its</b> pronouns. Below, you'll find some more specific information about me! :)</p>

		            <h2>Interests</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>I am very interested in linguistics and constructed languages, but I am not particularly good at it at this time. Feel free to teach me something random about linguistics if you want to! I currently know/am learning the following languages:</li>
                    <li>I mess around with FL Studio from time to time and I'm really into music as a whole. Feel free to recommend albums for me to listen! My username on Rate Your Music is <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/~lassc">lassc</a>.</li>
                    <li>I am currently in college learning computer science. Most of my interest lies in programming language and desktop application development at this time.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I also actively use Linux on a day-to-day basis! For now, I simply use standard Pop! OS but I am planning on creating a whole desktop experience for myself using Void Linux.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>I am a somewhat active lurker on the SCP Wiki, and I want to start writing articles of my own!</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Do not interact</h2>
                <p>Please do not contact me if you are one of the following. I <i>will</i> block you if I find out you are one of these. This is not a comprehensive list; you may be blocked for reasons that are completely unrelated to these. The general rule of thumb is if you were blocked, I consider you to be some form of an asshole! <3</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A capitalist ideology supporter or apologizer (neoliberals, social democrats, "democratic socialists" and anyone else that would say the phrase "crony capitalism" seriously- verbatim or not).</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Climate change denialists (includes stuff like "climate change won't be that bad"),</li>
                        <li>Tools of capitalist states, such as cops and members of the military,</li>
                        <li>and imperialist/colonialist apologists or chauvinists of any form.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>A trans- or sex-exclusionary "feminist", transmedicalist, or sysmedicalist.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This includes those that consider neopronouns/xenogenders to be invalid!</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>

                <h2>How to contact me</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Email me at <a href="mailto:lassc@lassc.net">lassc@lassc.net</a> if you have long-form impersonal questions about the stuff that I post here! I respond to them in subsequent posts to expand on stuff that I may have missed :)</li>
                    <li>My Discord is @alice!#8429, but do be warned that I may ignore you if you just send a friend request without a message.</li>
                    <li>I do not have anything other than Discord or Matrix as modern social media is a plague to nuance.</li>
