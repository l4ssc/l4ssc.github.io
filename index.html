                <p>Hello there! My name is Alice. I am 19 years old, quoiromantic, asexual, <a href="https://gender.fandom.com/wiki/Genderfae">genderfae</a>, and identify with the <a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Voidpunk">voidpunk</a> subculture. I use <b>fae/faer</b> and <b>it/its</b> pronouns. Below, you'll find some more specific information about me! :) As of March 2nd, this site is incomplete and will contain various things like more information about myself and a blog.</p>

		<h2>Interests</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>I am very interested in linguistics and constructed languages, but I am not particularly good at it at this time. Feel free to teach me something random about linguistics if you want to! I currently know toki pona to a large extent and am planning to learn Viossa and Japanese in the future.</li>
                    <li>I mess around with FL Studio from time to time and I'm really into music as a whole. Feel free to recommend albums for me to listen! My username on Rate Your Music is <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/~lassc">lassc</a>.</li>
                    <li>I am currently in college learning computer science. Most of my interest lies in programming language and desktop application development at this time.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I also actively use Linux on a day-to-day basis! I am currently working on modifying my Arch Linux setup, and will post a blog post with pictures once I am able to.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>I am a somewhat active lurker on the SCP Wiki, and I want to start writing articles of my own!</li>

                <p>Please do not contact me if you are one of the following. I <i>will</i> block you if I find out you are one of these. This is not a comprehensive list; you may be blocked for reasons that are completely unrelated to these.

                        <li>Imperialist/colonialist apologists or chauvinists of any form,</li>

                    </ul>
                </ul>
